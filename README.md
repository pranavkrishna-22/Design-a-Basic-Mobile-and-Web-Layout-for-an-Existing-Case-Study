# Design a Basic Mobile and Web Layout for an Existing Case Study

This experiment focuses on understanding responsive design principles by creating basic layouts for both mobile and web platforms based on an existing case study. The goal is to learn how to adapt UI elements to different screen sizes while maintaining usability and visual consistency.

---

## Objective

To practice designing user interfaces that work seamlessly across mobile and desktop devices by applying responsive design techniques and usability principles to a real-world case study.

## Experiment Overview

### Aim
- To create wireframes and mockups of a given case study’s application or website for both mobile and web platforms.
- To ensure usability and aesthetic consistency in multiple screen sizes.
- To apply responsive design best practices.

### Tools
- Design: Figma / Adobe XD / Sketch
- Prototyping: Figma / Adobe XD
- Research: Existing case study documentation or website/app screenshots

## Procedure and Steps

1. **Select the Case Study**  
   Choose an existing product or website with both web and mobile presence (e.g., e-commerce site, news app, or portfolio).

2. **Analyze Current UI**  
   - Collect screenshots or demo links of the existing product on both platforms.
   - Note core features, navigation elements, and content structure.
   - Identify areas that could be improved or simplified.

3. **Define Design Requirements**  
   - List essential components that must be present on both platforms.
   - Note any platform-specific behaviors or layout changes.

4. **Create Wireframes**  
   - Sketch low-fidelity wireframes for mobile and web versions separately.
   - Focus on layout, hierarchy, and navigation.
   - Use grids and layout guidelines suitable for each device.

5. **Design High-Fidelity Mockups**  
   - Develop detailed UI mockups incorporating colors, typography, icons, and imagery.
   - Maintain visual consistency across platforms.
   - Use responsive design principles like fluid grids, scalable typography, and adaptable images.

6. **Prototype Interaction (Optional)**  
   - Create clickable prototypes to demonstrate navigation and responsiveness.
   - Link common user flows (e.g., homepage to product page).

7. **Review and Iterate**  
   - Conduct informal usability tests or heuristic reviews.
   - Note feedback and revise layouts accordingly.
